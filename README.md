# scratchpad

A simple PWA to type some notes like grocery list or things to remember, stored locally in browser local storage.

They will be kept until browser cache (site preference to be more precise) is flushed.

Thereâ€™s a [branch with firebase integration](https://github.com/paulgreg/scratchpad/tree/with-firebase) that you can host yourself with a firebase account.
