# scratchpad

A simple PWA to type some notes like grocery list or things to remember, stored locally in browser local storage.

They will be kept until browser cache (site preference to be more precise) is flushed.

## Self-hosting variants

There is a [branch](https://github.com/paulgreg/scratchpad/tree/json-store) storing data on server (using [json-store](https://github.com/paulgreg/json-store), a simple way to store json).

There is also a [branch with firebase integration](https://github.com/paulgreg/scratchpad/tree/with-firebase).
