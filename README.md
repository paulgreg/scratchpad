# scratchpad

A simple PWA to type some notes like grocery list or things to remember, stored locally in browser local storage and on server (using [json-store](https://github.com/paulgreg/json-store), a simple way to store json).

They will be kept until browser cache (site preference to be more precise) is flushed.

## Configuration

You’ll need to copy `settings.dist.js` to `settings.js` and update corresponding secret (according one defined on json-store)

## Alternate branch

There’s a [branch with firebase integration](https://github.com/paulgreg/scratchpad/tree/with-firebase) that you can host yourself with a firebase account.
