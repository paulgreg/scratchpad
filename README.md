# scratchpad

A simple PWA to type some notes like grocery list or things to remember, stored locally in browser local storage.

They will be kept until browser cache (site preference to be more precise) is flushed or in a [Firebase Realtime database](https://firebase.google.com/docs/database).

If you don’t plan to use firebase, there’s a [branch before firebase integration](https://github.com/paulgreg/scratchpad/tree/without-firebase).
